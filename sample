**Subject: Re: Follow-Up on Our Conversation**

**Hi [Managerâ€™s Name],**

Thank you so much for your kind words and understanding. It has been a privilege to work with such a supportive and talented team. I will truly miss everyone here, and I hope we can stay in touch and possibly work together again in the future.

I wanted to let you know that I will be moving to Whitby, Ontario. I should be able to commute to Toronto, ON for work if required. I appreciate your efforts in exploring any potential opportunities through RBC or a future technology hub in Canada.

Regarding communication with the team, I would prefer if you could send out a communication to the entire team. I think it would be the most efficient way to let everyone know, and I trust your judgment in how best to convey the news.

Thank you again for everything. I am truly grateful for the experiences and support I've had here.

Best regards,

[Your Full Name]  
[Your Job Title]  
[Your Contact Information]
