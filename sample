**Subject: Heartfelt Thanks**

**Hi [Manager’s Name],**

As tomorrow is my last day, I wanted to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude to you. Working under your leadership has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my career. Your kindness, calm demeanor, and unwavering support have made a significant impact on me, both professionally and personally.

You’ve always gone above and beyond to help me, and I’ve truly appreciated the way you’ve always looked out for me and the team. Your ability to lead with such grace and understanding is something I greatly admire, and I’ve learned so much from you.

It’s rare to find a manager who genuinely cares about their team the way you do, and I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with you. As I move on to this new chapter in Canada, I will carry with me the lessons and values you’ve imparted.

Thank you once again for everything. I hope we can stay in touch, and I wish you continued success and happiness in all that you do.

**Best regards,**
