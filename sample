Hey Jack, I need some time to discuss one matter with you.

This is a somthing that I'm going through. 

1) You already know that I'm working on a temporary Visa in the US.
2) I have my family back in India and I also have a younger Sister as well.
3) My sister has a daughter. My neice is diagnosed with Autism and we have been trying to manage it for the past 3 or 4 years 
4) The system for such children is not very supportive in India and also it very very expensive..
5) In western countries there is good system to support such kids
6) Since I'm on temp visa, And my GC is not any way near me, I cannot bring my sis into the US legally... to support her child
7) The reason I'm explaining all these is, I'm a Canadian PR holder and I can legally live and work in Canada and I can also immediately sponsor my sis and her family
8) This will be really helpful for her situation

My request is, I need a change of location. I would like to see if CNB will allow me to work from Canada and I can continue to do all the support which I'm currently doing.

The payroll should be canada payroll and not US payroll. I know this is a complicated request but I would like to know if this is feasible or not?
