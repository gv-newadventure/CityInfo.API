“Hi everyone,

I wanted to take a moment to thank each and every one of you for the incredible experience I’ve had working with this team. The decision to move to Canada and take on a new role was a very personal one, primarily driven by family considerations and the opportunity to utilize my permanent resident status there.

I’ve truly enjoyed collaborating with all of you, and I’ve learned so much during my time here. I’ll do everything I can to ensure a smooth transition and am here to support you all during this period.

I hope we can stay in touch, and who knows, maybe our paths will cross again in the future. Thank you again for your understanding and support.”

Transition Planning: Focus on handing over your responsibilities and ensuring a smooth transition.
