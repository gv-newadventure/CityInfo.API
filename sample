Subject: Request for Vacation Leave Approval

Dear [Manager’s Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request approval for a two-week vacation leave from [start date] to [end date]. 

During my absence, I have made arrangements to ensure that my ongoing projects/tasks are covered. [Briefly mention any relevant plans or preparations you have made.]

I believe that taking this time off will not only allow me to recharge and return with renewed energy and focus but also ensure continuity and efficiency in our team’s operations.

Please let me know if there are any specific procedures or forms I need to complete as part of this request. I am more than happy to provide any additional information or assistance needed to facilitate a smooth transition during my absence.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I look forward to your approval and guidance regarding the next steps.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
