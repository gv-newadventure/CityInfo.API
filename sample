Subject: Apologies for Not Speaking Personally and Best Wishes

Hi Ricky,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out personally to apologize for not having the opportunity to speak with you directly before the news of my resignation was announced.

I have greatly appreciated your support, understanding, and guidance over the past two years. Working with you has been a wonderful experience, and I have always felt valued and respected on our projects. Your leadership and approach have made a significant positive impact on my professional growth.

As I move on to this new chapter in Canada, I wanted to extend my heartfelt thanks to you for everything. Your kindness and encouragement have meant a lot to me, and I will always cherish the time spent working together.

I wish you all the best in your future endeavors and hope that our paths might cross again someday. Please do stay in touch.

Thank you once again for being such a great mentor and leader.

Best regards,
Ganesh.
