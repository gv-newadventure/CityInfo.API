Opening:

“Hi Jack, thank you for taking the time to meet with me today. I want to start by expressing my gratitude for the opportunities and support I’ve received here. Working with this team has been incredibly rewarding.”

The Announcement:

Hey Jack, I want to share an important update with you.

“After much consideration, I have made the difficult decision to resign from my position. You see, This was not an easy choice, but it is based on some personal and family reasons that require me to move to Canada. I recently received a job offer in Canada, and I strongly hope that this move will benefit me and my family in the long run"

Expressing Gratitude:

“I want you to know how much I’ve valued my time here. The support, trust, and opportunities you’ve provided have been instrumental in my professional growth. I deeply appreciate everything the company has done for me.”

Transition Offer:

“I am committed to ensuring a smooth transition. I am happy to assist in any way possible during my notice period, whether it’s training someone new, wrapping up projects, or being available for any questions. I want to make sure that the team continues to succeed.”

Closing:

“Thank you again for everything. This was a very hard decision for me, and I hope we can stay in touch. I am truly grateful for my time here.”

I also appreciate your consideration of potential future opportunities. While I cannot accept any immediate counter offers due to my commitment to my new role for at least the next six months, I am open to discussing the possibility of working as a contractor from Canada through a vendor after this initial period. I would be willing to explore this option if it aligns with my career goals and compensation expectations.
