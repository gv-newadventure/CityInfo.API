I hope this message finds you well. I recently worked on a new user story related to image creation for incoming wires. I have successfully incorporated the required changes and merged them into the master branch. The specific class affected is clsBOBNKCurrDay.

To ensure the seamless execution of these changes, I am seeking clarification on whether this code is executed within our Agillink web application or if it is managed by a Windows service. Understanding the execution environment is crucial for further testing and validation.

Your insights on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time and assistance.
