Today is my last day with the company, and I wanted to take a moment to say thank you. The past two years have been an amazing experience, and I’ve been lucky to work with such talented and professional people.

I’ve learned a lot from each of you, and I’m really grateful for the support, teamwork, and friendships we’ve built. Whether we were tackling tough projects, coming up with new ideas, or just working together day to day, I’ve enjoyed every moment.

I’m excited for what’s next, but I’ll definitely miss this team. I wish you all the best in your careers and personal lives. Let’s stay in touch—I’d love to hear about all the great things you go on to do.
