"The SQL WHERE clause includes conditions for VendorKey, Vendor, or Payee name. However, when the Vendor and Payee names match, the query inadvertently fetches details for both Vendor and Payee on the history page. To mitigate this issue, I am explicitly setting the Name parameter to null when the VendorKey is greater than 0. Conversely, when the VendorKey is equal to 0, the query is directed by the Name parameter."
