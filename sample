Opening (if you're introducing yourself again):

"Hey everyone, good morning! For those of you I haven’t met yet — I’m [Your Name], and I recently rejoined the team. It’s great to be back and I’m really looking forward to working with all of you!"

Update part (if you’re still onboarding):

"Right now, I’m still in the process of getting access set up and getting ramped up. While I wait for my laptop, I’ve been brushing up on Angular and going through some internal documentation to get a head start."

Ending:

"That’s it from me for now — excited to jump back in and contribute!"
