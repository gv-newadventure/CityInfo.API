Let's break down the statement piece by piece to make it clearer:

1. **Client referencing their own set of GL subcategories**: The application allows clients to use a specific set of General Ledger (GL) subcategories, which are essentially categories used for organizing financial data.

2. **Must always be identical to the template version**: The client's set of subcategories should exactly match a predefined template version. Any differences between the client's version and the template will cause problems.

3. **Any deviation will result in problems**: If there are differences between the client's subcategories and the template, issues will arise in the application.

4. **Cannot be resolved by the user in the UI**: The problems caused by these differences cannot be fixed or resolved by the user through the application's user interface (UI). 

5. **Necessitating application staff intervention**: Resolving these issues requires the intervention of staff or personnel who work with the application.

6. **Current design does not insert a subcategory for an item that is not new**: The software design does not allow for the addition of a subcategory to an existing item unless it is a completely new item.

7. **Software cannot recover from the condition of a missing subcategory**: If a subcategory is missing due to the above limitation, the software cannot automatically correct or recover from this situation on its own.

In essence, this statement is highlighting a critical requirement for the client's subcategories to match a template exactly. If there are any differences, users won't be able to fix these issues themselves, and application staff will need to step in to resolve them. The software's inability to insert subcategories for existing items and its inability to recover from missing subcategories further emphasize the importance of maintaining consistency between the client's subcategories and the template.
